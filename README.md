this is/was a hacky experiment!

it pulled record samples from every lexicon with https://ufos-api.microcosm.blue/ , enriched the content with https://constellation.microcosm.blue/ , and used https://github.com/mary-ext/atcute for identity resolution and content fetching. With a few heuristics it made a kind of global feed of activity from all atproto apps.

i'd like to revisit it but that's currently deep backlog.
